<h3>Storyline:</h3>

When Stark finds his personal world destroyed at his enemy's hands, he embarks on a harrowing quest to find those responsible. This journey, at every turn, will test his mettle. With his back against the wall, Stark is left to survive by his own devices, relying on his ingenuity and instincts to protect those closest to him.

<h3>Review:</h3>
<p>The third instalment of the highly-successful Iron Man franchise goes off in a different direction to its predecessors.In this film, you will find one of the best action sequences of the superhero movie. The plot gets a little messy at times and the morality beneath it is quite obvious, but without a doubt, the film is excessively fun.There are big plot twists in the movie but it by no means ruins the movie. It tells a larger plot and deals with trickier villains for Tony Stark to play around. We can still root for their world's innovations and characters. The parts that are suppose to be deep are however sometimes contrived and obvious. But the film is thankful to have something to cover up some of its flaws, example is scattering the entire film with humor, and of course, explosions. It's all naturally fun mostly thanks to the cast. Robert Downey Jr. is still brilliant as Tony Stark and he explores more of the character.</p><br/>
