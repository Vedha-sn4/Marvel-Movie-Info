<h3>Review</h3>
<p>As I am a great fan of marvel
Avengers: Endgame, which marks the end of the Infinity Saga, is spellbinding and surely an enthralling experience. It is remarkable and doesn't disappoint. Watching all our favorite superheroes in one film is just surpassing.The film has a great balance of humor, emotions, and action. The biggest strength of the film is the emotions. This is the most emotional superhero film I have ever seen. It's just perfect. The action sequences were jaw-dropping. The climactic battle left me amazed. It's just filled with memorable moments and cannot be described with words. The visuals are gorgeous and have a great impact on the film. The background score gives me goosebumps, though I've listened to it several times.</p><br/>
