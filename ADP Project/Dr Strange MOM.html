<h3>Review:</h3>
<p>Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness is darker & more violent than any previous MCU movie, which could be considered a strength.The plot is super weak,the script is also very erroneous with some strange and unexplainable writing decisions. The story isn't continuous with the character and does leave you with mixed emotions of confusion,excitement,astonishment,grief but trust me it would be worth of a watch. The horror elements in the film was good.Benedict cumberbech as Dr Stephen strange the master of mystic arts He's amazing and he's more wiser than ever.r. The movie has a ton of past references from the MCU,Fantastic Four,Disney and also the comics,and one could understand and enjoy those references only if they are familiar with the past timeline and have read a handful of comics.The story and plot of the movie however,focuses more on the character of Wanda Maximoff and Scarlet Witch,though the screentime of Strange is more than that of Wanda.Different versions of Doctor Strange from alternate realities have been explored in the movie which provides a deep insight into the multiverse and its infinite possibilites,an idea rather very untouched or not dived deep into in the previous marvel movies.Also,one thing that made a little dissapointed was the length of the movie,which could have been a bit longer since everything seemed to kinda end up in a hurry.</p><br/>
