<h3>Review:</h3>
<p>Spider-Man: No Way Home is a phenomenal conclusion to the trilogy and Holland's best outing as Spidey yet. Starts off fun, safe and familiar and then becomes extremely emotional, satisfying and full of great callbacks.Tom Holland gives an incredible lead performance once again, reliably charming and likeable but with a lot more emotional heft this time around. Zendaya and Jacob Batalon both have perfect chemistry with Holland and are also incredible in their own ways. Benedict Cumberbatch reaffirms why he's such a good Doctor Strange with his excellent dry wit and gravitas. All the returning villains give strong performances but Willem Dafoe is definitely the standout performance with an unsettling and terrifying presence. The reentry of Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield as Spider-man was amazing.both of them nailed their role. The action sequences were well choreographed especially three spideys fighting the villans together was a delight to spidey fans.The CG is extremely impressive with only a few weak spots.
