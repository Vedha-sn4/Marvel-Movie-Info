<h3>Storyline:</h3>
<p>With many people fearing the actions of super heroes, the government decides to push for the Hero Registration Act, a law that limits a hero's actions. This results in a division in The Avengers. Iron Man stands with this Act, claiming that their actions must be kept in check otherwise cities will continue to be destroyed, but Captain America feels that saving the world is daring enough and that they cannot rely on the government to protect the world. This escalates into an all-out war between Team Iron Man (Iron Man, Black Panther, Vision, Black Widow, War Machine, and Spider-Man) and Team Captain America (Captain America, Bucky Barnes, Falcon, Scarlet Witch, Hawkeye, and Ant Man) while a new villain emerges.</p></br>

<h3>Review:</h3>
<p>Captain America Civil War is a gripping, bold, smart and awesome superhero movie. It boasts of a talented cast, a great direction and awesome action sequences. Matching spectacular and epic moments with the smarts of a great, grown up thriller. The writing was good and the acting was great. The characters are well written.Chris Evans and Robert Downey Jr deliver performances of a kind you'd have rarely seen before in a superhero film. You rarely get to feel you're watching Chris and Downey, the stars.The final battle between Cap,Bucky and Ironman was amazing.Other actors do a great job as well. We are introduced to two new characters such as Black Panther and Spider-Man, even in their minimum screentime they were amazing. Zemo is also a good side villain in this movie.It takes time and depth to understand Tony's decisons, during the final moments of the final battle he was consumed by vengeance and his emotions and not guided by his intellect. And lastly with fantastic CGI and music it is overall an enjoyable film.</p><br/>
