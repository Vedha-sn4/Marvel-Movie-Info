<h3>Storyline:</h3>
<p>Tony Stark. Genius, billionaire, playboy, philanthropist. Son of legendary inventor and weapons contractor Howard Stark. When Tony Stark is assigned to give a weapons presentation to an Iraqi unit led by Lt. Col. James Rhodes, he's given a ride on enemy lines. That ride ends badly when Stark's Humvee that he's riding in is attacked by enemy combatants. He survives - barely - with a chest full of shrapnel and a car battery attached to his heart. In order to survive he comes up with a way to miniaturize the battery and figures out that the battery can power something else. Thus Iron Man is born. He uses the primitive device to escape from the cave in Iraq. Once back home, he then begins work on perfecting the Iron Man suit. But the man who was put in charge of Stark Industries has plans of his own to take over Tony's technology for other matters.</p></br>

<h3>Review:</h3>
<p>Iron Man is one of the better superhero movies.This is a very entertaining action film and is such a great blockbuster that is sure to please any film buff.The acting is better than expected in this film. Robert Downey Jr. did such a unexpected great job. His performance is intriguing, and unexpected. Robert Downey Jr,he really is Iron Man. He manages to give that real sense of a "genius, billionaire, playboy, philanthropist." It's hard to imagine anybody else playing Tony Stark this far along in the franchise's lifespan.It serves as a perfect introduction to Tony Stark's character. Gwyneth Paltrow did well as her role of Pepper Potts. Special effects and cool technology reigns supreme as we are presented with a multitude of visual and auditory spectacle. The suit feels real and it provides scenes that both thrill and generate humor.</p><br/>
