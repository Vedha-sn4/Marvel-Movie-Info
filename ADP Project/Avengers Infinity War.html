<h3>Review</h3>
<p>Avengers infinity war is an emotional roller coaster.It has a great story, great acting, and awesome looking.Let's start with Thanos, definitely one of the best villains, he has a motive, is well played, you can even say that Infinity war tells his story and not the story of a hero. But also most of the other cast members were great in their role and again.Infinity war is stunning, hilarious and heartbreaking.</p><br/>
