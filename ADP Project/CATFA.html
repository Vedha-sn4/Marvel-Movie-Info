<h3>Review</h3>
<p>It is a very good origin story, and I'm personally a big fan of Captain America so this movie was a nice watch for me. Showing the good old retro 1940s style and production design, since this film is directed by Joe Johnson who is capable of portraying the old times perfectly. The styles and hair, the settings, and the overall feel to the film were near perfect.As I watched, I felt like I was transported to a different time. The casting is perfect. Chris Evans did a great job as Captain America. It is a good motivational movie to watch.Captain America is wholesome, compassionate, and brave. Some of the action scenes are disappointingly unexciting but at least the CGI effects are eye candy. Overall, this is one of the most satisfying superhero movies or action movies.</p><br/>
