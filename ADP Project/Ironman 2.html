<h3>Review:</h3>
<p>This movie contains some throughly enjoyable moments that are on par with some of Downey Jr's highlights as Tony Stark. He once again gives an incredible performance and is extremely charismatic It contains some really cool and innovative action scenes which are taken for granted now. Another big addition in this movie is Scarlett Johansson as Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow. Johansson makes for a fun addition to the growing MCU, and her dynamic with Downey makes for an interesting partnership. epper Potts, played by Gwenyth Paltrow,has a bigger role in this movie as acting president of Stark Industries, and she gets some very funny moments when playing off of Downey. However the poor villain, a pattern in Iron Man Solo Outings, and the lack of direction meant this is easily the poorest Iron Man Performance.But it is still an entertaining watch</p><br/>
