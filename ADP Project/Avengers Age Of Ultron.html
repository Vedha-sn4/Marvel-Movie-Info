<h3>Review</h3>
<p>This film isn't nearly as bad as some people make it out to be. While the story isn't as good as the first Avengers, the acting is still just as good, the action is even better, and Ultron isn't a bad villain, he's just an under-developed one. Honestly, the action makes up for most of the flaws of this movie and it also set up a lot of MCU films, or at least foreshadowed a lot.Overall, this isn't a bad film, at all, but it is the weakest of The Avengers franchise.</p><br/>
