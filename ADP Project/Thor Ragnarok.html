<h3>Review:</h3>
<p>Thor ragnarok is a magnificent film that realises that Thor should be more than a 1 dimensional and boring character with personality, he should be fun and kinda goofy. The fight scenes are fun and engaging and never bore the viewer. The writing is absolutley fantastic and nearly each character feels fleshed out. The movie is always fun and exciting with its wacky locations and scenery that always pops out with colour. The CGI is mostly great, and the colors are bold, playful, diverse, seemingly perfectly chosen for the film's story.  There are some continuity issues, especially towards the end, but they're masked so well that a normal viewer wouldn't even notice them. Chris Hemsworth did a very good job as Thor.He is given more opportunities to showcase his comedic skills. Hela, the villain of the film doesn't feel flehed out enough and comes of as generic and boring, it feels like she holds back the film and if she was explored deeper as a character or removed completley from. she serves as another forgettable mcu villain.Tom Hiddleston is once again entertaining as Loki. And this is probably the best I have seen of Mark Ruffalo’s Hulk too.Tessa Thompson also makes her MCU debut and she is also really memorable. She’s a great addition to the MCU.Overall Thor ragnarok is crazy amounts of fun with some brilliant acting and pacing and this is a huge improvement for the character of Thor, and a big step forward too</p><br/>
