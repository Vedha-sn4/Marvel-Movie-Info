<h3>Storyline:</h3>
<p>For Steve Rogers, awakening after decades of suspended animation involves more than catching up on pop culture; it also means that this old school idealist must face a world of subtler threats and difficult moral complexities. That becomes clear when Director Nick Fury is killed by the mysterious assassin, the Winter Soldier, but not before warning Rogers that SHIELD has been subverted by its enemies. When Rogers acts on Fury's warning to trust no one there, he is branded as a traitor by the organization. Now a fugitive, Captain America must get to the bottom of this deadly mystery with the help of the Black Widow and his new friend, The Falcon. However, the battle will be costly for the Sentinel of Liberty, with Rogers finding enemies where he least expects them while learning that the Winter Soldier looks disturbingly familiar.</p></br>

<h3>Review:</h3>
<p>This is one of the movie, where action speak louder than words.If anyone truly evolved as a action film maker,I have to say,the Russo brothers are correct examples.The dialogues are also excellent and careful written as well as the casting. Chris Evans was an absolute badass. I love his navy blue suit and shield in the beginning of the film. The blue and silver shield looks nice.Scarlett Johansson too played a good role in the film.Her action sequences were amazing.The pairing of Captain America and Black Widow was good. The Movie does justice to the evolution of Bucky James as a brainwashed manipulated hydra henchman than transforming into a vulnerable human towards end and walking his journey back alone with or without being triumphed. The friendship between Cap and Bucky was well potrayed.Falcon too played a good supporting role and a supporter for Captain America. In most parts of it, you think that you are in the movie and you feel that you are experiencing the emotions of the characters.Captain America: Winter Soldier is a masterpiece.</p><br/>
