<h3>Review</h3>
<p>Being a blockbuster, "The Avengers" does have all the elements to entertain the crowd. The idea of putting all the superheroes in one film is a good idea.The movie has a very good balance of heroism and humour, great characters' development, an interesting villain, and great action-packed sequences.The visual effects are great, especially the finale which lasts for an hour! The massive destruction of Manhattan is literally earth shattering, I was quite in awe of the aliens flying through the skyline, and all the action that goes on.</p><br/>
