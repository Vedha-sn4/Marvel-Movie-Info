<h3>Review:</h3>
<p>Doctor Strange is one of the best action movies ever made. The film depicts what a superhero should be, without mentioning it verbally even once. The visual effects are the first thing one would remember this film for. I mean, I still can't understand how could one imagine something as creatively complex as this. As the viewer sits and experiences the action sequences filled with mind-bending effects and creativity, one can't help but feel it's one of the greatest visual spectacles of all time. Benedict Cumberbatch's performance as an arrogant doctor who goes on to become one of the most powerful superheroes, or the "Master of the Mystic Arts" as he is called, is nothing but outstanding. Tilda Swinton as the Ancient One is really impressive.Her dialogues are sharp and deep at the same time. Other actors are also impressive, including Rachel McAdams who plays more than just the hero's love interest, and Benedict Wong who just like his name lives up to the character of Wong. Dormammu was perfectly put on the big screen as he's a giant space God who can not die he couldn't of been easy to put into a movie. the fight scenes are always a joy to watch as you never know what wacky move there going to use next. </p><br/>
