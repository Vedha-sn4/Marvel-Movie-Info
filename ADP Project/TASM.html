<h3>Review:</h3>
<p>I honestly think this is a really underrated movie. It has great visuals, including the web-swinging scenes, and the opening titles. They especially look very good in 3D. Most of the characters were portrayed perfectly. Especially Peter Parker/Spider-Man as he is portrayed more accurately to the comics.The idea of Peter trying to uncover the disappearance of his parents is very original and well written.The action scenes are well shot and well-choreographed. Brilliant acting by all the actors. The Lizard has a connection to Peterâ€™s parents, building a stronger connection between the two. The theme of relationships and sacrifice is strongly represented in this film. It is a solid mix of humor, action, suspense, and drama. It also manages to feel both a realistic and a classic superhero movie.
